Ruby is a dynamic programming language with a complex but expressive grammar and
a core class library with a rich and powerful API. Ruby draws inspiration from Lisp,
Smalltalk, and Perl, but uses a grammar that is easy for C and Javaâ„¢ programmers to
learn. Ruby is a pure object-oriented language, but it is also suitable for procedural and
functional programming styles. It includes powerful metaprogramming capabilities
and can be used to create domain-specific languages or DSLs.
